## Next Work: Decision Points

### Before Proceeding to Phase 2

The strategy provides directions but leaves key decisions to leadership:

1. **Tool Partnerships** — Who should Gies partner with for secure AI access?
   - Options: Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, or institutional solution
   - Decision needed: Q4 2025 / Q1 2026

2. **Curriculum Model** — Foundational course for all vs. embedded across all courses?
   - Impacts scope, faculty development, scheduling
   - Decision needed: Q1 2026

3. **Budget Allocation** — What investment level across:
   - Faculty fellowships/training
   - Student tool access
   - Lab/incubation space
   - Research tokens
   - Decision needed: Q1 2026

4. **Graduate Sequencing** — Undergrad-first (2026) or parallel with grad (2026)?
   - Impacts workload and rollout timeline
   - Decision needed: Q1 2026

5. **Industry Partnerships** — 50 partnerships realistic? What recruitment strategy?
   - Building on iVenture model
   - Decision needed: Q2 2026
