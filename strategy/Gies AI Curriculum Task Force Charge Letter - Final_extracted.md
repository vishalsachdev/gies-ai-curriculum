Dear Colleagues, 
Thank you for agreeing to serve on the Gies AI Curriculum Task Force. This charge sets out our 
purpose, scope of work, and expectations for how we will collaborate over the coming months. 
The task force’s purpose is to define and guide AI-integrated learning for Gies students across our 
undergraduate and graduate programs. Our work will proceed in parallel with the Provost’s 
Campus AI Curriculum Task Force and information will be shared across both committees to 
ensure that Gies’ efforts are aligned with campus standards and opportunities, while reflecting the 
distinctive needs of our business disciplines and learners. 
The committee is asked to achieve the following goals, earmarking Fall 2026 as the 
implementation semester for AI learning initiatives that impact our undergraduate populations 
(Business Majors and Business Minors) as a top college priority. 
• Develop clear learning objectives for AI fluency and responsible use, as well as learning 
objectives for applied, discipline-specific AI competencies. 
• Recommend how these learning outcomes should be integrated into the Gies undergraduate 
and graduate core curricula; and provide guidelines for how discipline-specific AI 
competencies should appear within degree major and elective coursework. 
• Review existing and proposed business/data analytics degree programs (e.g., MSBA, 
MSBAi, Business Analytics Minor) and concentrations (e.g., Data Analytics in 
Accountancy, Business Analytics); and provide recommendations on how AI can be 
integrated into these curricula. The Campus AI Curriculum Task Force will be reviewing 
the +DS and CS minor curricula with the goal of making similar recommendations.

• Identify existing courses—or propose new offerings—that could contribute to campus-
level AI initiatives such as short-form credentials, open content courses, the campus-wide 
AI Minor, and X+AI degrees.  
• Conduct market and student research to understand the AI skills need of our students and 
the businesses that recruit our students.  
• Assess and provide recommendations on resources and governance structures that will be 
required for sustainable implementation of AI curricula, including secure access to AI 
tools, faculty and staff development, TA training, assessment of learning (AoL) 
approaches, and guidance on academic integrity, ethics, accessibility, and data governance. 
Our approach will be learner-first, evidence-informed, and grounded in faculty expertise and staff 
experience. Recommendations should be feasible to implement and concrete enough to guide 
curriculum mapping and course design, and pragmatic enough to scale across academic units. All 
committee work will be in coordination with department curriculum committees and will be shared 
with the Undergraduate and Graduate Program Advisory Committees at key milestones to ensure 
broad input and smooth adoption. Staff leaders will support the task force in an ex-officio capacity 
with student, market, and careers data, accreditation insights, and documentation. 
To begin, the task force will inventory current AI-related learning across departments, leveraging 
work already done by the Gies AI Task Force and the BA Department AI Committee. Deliverables, 
timelines, and sub-working groups will be determined in our first set of meetings. 
We are grateful for your leadership and look forward to our collaboration on this important work 
for our students and our college. 
Best,
