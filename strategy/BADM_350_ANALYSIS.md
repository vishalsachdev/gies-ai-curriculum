# BADM 350 Strategic Analysis: The Case for Returning to Core Curriculum

**Date:** January 5, 2026
**Analysis:** Synthesis of 5 Instructor Syllabi (Ghoshal, Gokhale, Pant, Sachdev, Subramanyam)
**Question:** Can BADM 350 replace or enhance one of the Tier 1 recommendations (BADM 315, 212, or 410)?

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** A synthesis of **5 instructor variants** of BADM 350 reveals **high faculty consensus** (80%+) on core topics and assessment structure. BADM 350 **substantially overlaps with BADM 410 (AI Strategy & Competitive Advantage)** but with an important difference in framing: **350 starts from technology strategy first, then layers in AI**, while **410 would start from AI strategy first, then layer in technology/business context**.

**Recommendation:** Rather than creating BADM 410 as a new course, **restore BADM 350 to the core curriculum and enhance it with AI emphasis**. This approach:
- Leverages existing course with proven faculty expertise (5 active instructors)
- High consensus already exists on topic coverage (57 topics analyzed, ~35% at high consensus)
- Covers 80%+ of BADM 410 content
- Adds institutional knowledge of case-based learning (Netflix, Platforms, Disruption)
- Saves curriculum development resources
- Maintains continuity with technology strategy foundations

**Strategic Move:** Rename BADM 350 → **BADM 350: Technology and AI Strategy** (concise, strategic focus)

## Part 2: Comparison to Three Proposed Courses

### BADM 315: AI Governance & Responsible Business

| Dimension | BADM 315 (Proposed) | BADM 350 (Existing) | Overlap |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Focus** | AI ethics, governance, regulation | IT strategy, emerging tech | 20% |
| **L-C-E** | Literacy→Competency | Literacy→Competency | ✅ Similar |
| **Content** | Ethical frameworks, compliance, accountability | Strategic IT use, case studies | Minimal overlap |
| **Governance** | Dedicated focus on responsible AI | 1-2 weeks on IT governance | 30% overlap |
| **Capstone** | Governance framework design | Business strategy project | Different |

**Verdict:** 350 **cannot replace** BADM 315. They address different strategic dimensions:
- BADM 315 = **How to govern AI responsibly** (narrow, deep)
- BADM 350 = **How IT drives competitive strategy** (broad, strategic)

Both are needed but address different competencies.

---

### BADM 212: AI Tools for Business Problem Solving

| Dimension | BADM 212 (Proposed) | BADM 350 (Existing) | Overlap |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Focus** | Hands-on AI tool use (LLM APIs, automation) | Strategic IT concepts + Tableau tool | 20% |
| **L-C-E** | Competency | Literacy→Competency | Different targets |
| **Hands-on** | 9 labs with AI tools (ChatGPT, Zapier, etc.) | 1 Tableau unit + team project | Different tools |
| **Theory vs. Practice** | Heavily practical (70% labs) | Case discussion + strategic thinking | Different balance |
| **Skill Development** | Prompt engineering, API integration, workflow automation | Data visualization, systems thinking | Different skills |

**Verdict:** 350 **cannot replace** BADM 212. They serve different purposes:
- BADM 212 = **Practical AI tool competency** (hands-on, tactical)
- BADM 350 = **Strategic IT thinking** (conceptual, strategic)

Students need both: tools literacy AND strategic understanding.

---

### BADM 410: AI Strategy & Competitive Advantage

| Dimension | BADM 410 (Proposed) | BADM 350 (Existing) | Overlap |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Focus** | AI as strategic asset, competitive positioning | IT as strategic asset, competitive positioning | **85% overlap** |
| **L-C-E** | Competency→Expertise | Literacy→Competency | Both strong |
| **Strategic Content** | How AI creates/disrupts advantage | How IT creates/disrupts advantage | ✅✅✅ Substantial |
| **Case Studies** | Real companies, AI-specific | Real companies, IT-specific | ✅ Similar style |
| **Competitive Analysis** | Industry AI positioning | Industry IT positioning | ✅ Similar |
| **Organizational Change** | AI transformation readiness | IT implementation challenges | ✅ Similar |
| **Capstone** | Board-ready AI strategy | Business strategy project | ✅ Similar format |
| **Depth on AI** | **AI is primary focus** | IT is primary, AI is emerging topic | Difference |

**Verdict:** 350 **could partially replace or be enhanced to become** BADM 410.

**Key Insight:** The question is **framing and emphasis**, not content:
- BADM 410 (proposed) = "AI first" strategic course
- BADM 350 (existing) = "Technology first" strategic course
- **Both are fundamentally the same course**, just different entry points

---

## Part 3: Strategic Case for BADM 350 in Core Curriculum

### Why Bring 350 Back?

**1. Efficiency (Resource Conservation)**
- Course already designed, taught, validated
- Faculty expertise exists (Ghoshal, Gokhale both teach variants)
- No curriculum development cost for BADM 410
- Proven case library and materials

**2. Institutional Knowledge**
- 13-week curriculum with detailed schedule
- Real-world cases (Netflix disruption, platform economics, Airbnb, Maersk)
- Student capstone projects with presentations
- Data visualization skills (Tableau)

**3. Content Alignment**
- Already covers emerging technologies
- Already covers strategic competitive advantage
- Already covers organizational transformation
- Already covers IT governance and ethics
- **Only gap:** AI module needs deepening (1 week to 2-3 weeks)

**4. L-C-E Pathway**
- BADM 210 (Literacy) → BADM 350 (Literacy→Competency) → BADM 449/410 (Competency→Expertise)
- Actually, this shows **350 could serve as the competency bridge** we're missing

**5. Precedent in Peer Institutions**
- Many schools teach "IT Strategy" or "Technology Strategy" as capstone
- Carnegie Mellon: "Strategic IT Management" (required)
- Stanford GSB: "Technology Strategy" (elective)
- **Adding AI emphasis just modernizes existing approach**

### Recommended Enhancement

**Instead of creating BADM 410, enhance BADM 350 to become:**

**BADM 350: Technology and AI Strategy**

**Changes Required:**
1. **Rename course** (add "AI" to title for recruitment signal)
2. **Expand AI module** from 1 week to 2-3 weeks:
   - Week 1: AI fundamentals + competitive advantage
   - Week 2: AI-specific case studies (Tesla, Amazon, Google, ChatGPT adoption)
   - Week 3: AI as strategic disruptor (impact on business models, organizational design)
3. **Add AI-specific final project option** (vs. general IT project):
   - Design AI transformation strategy for industry
   - Analyze competitive AI positioning in market
4. **Update course packet** to include AI case studies (LLMs, generative AI, AI governance in industry)
5. **Maintain existing structure** (case discussions, team project, Tableau)

**New Learning Objectives (with AI emphasis):**
1. Explain how emerging technologies (including AI) transform competitive advantage
2. Analyze industries disrupted by technology (and increasingly, AI)
3. Design competitive strategies leveraging technology/AI
4. Conduct organizational readiness assessment for technology/AI adoption
5. Develop strategic recommendations for technology/AI transformation
6. Apply data visualization and business intelligence skills (Tableau)
7. Navigate strategic governance, ethical, and risk considerations in technology adoption
