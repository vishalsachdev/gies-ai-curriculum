## Assessment Alignment

Each learning outcome should be assessed through:

| Outcome Level | Assessment Types |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Literacy** | Quizzes, reflection papers, concept maps, discussion participation |
| **Competency** | Applied projects, case analyses, tool-based assignments, presentations |
| **Expertise** | Capstone projects, strategy recommendations, implementation plans |

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Modular Design:** Outcomes are designed as plug-in modules that can be added to existing courses without major restructuring.

2. **Scaffolding:** Literacy outcomes in Year 1-2 courses build foundation for Competency outcomes in Year 3-4 courses.

3. **Assessment Integration:** Add 1-2 AI-focused assessment items per course rather than replacing existing assessments.

4. **Faculty Support:** Each outcome requires faculty development on the specific AI tools and concepts involved.

5. **Continuous Update:** AI is rapidly evolving; outcomes should be reviewed annually for currency.
