# BADM 350: Course Redesign & Rebranding

**Date:** January 4, 2026
**Purpose:** Proposed new name, description, and focus for BADM 350 to emphasize AI strategy positioning

---

## Current Course Information

| Attribute | Current | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Number** | BADM 350 | Unchanged |
| **Title** | IT for Networked Organizations | ❌ Dated, too broad |
| **Description** | IT impact on modern organizations, emerging technologies | ⚠️ Vague, no AI emphasis |
| **Learning Focus** | Information systems strategy | ⚠️ Pre-AI era framing |
| **Capstone Type** | General IT project | ⚠️ Could be AI-specific |

---

## Recommended Rebranding

### Option 1: **RECOMMENDED** — "IT & AI Strategy for Competitive Advantage"

**New Title:**
> **BADM 350: IT & AI Strategy for Competitive Advantage**

**New Course Description:**
> How do organizations create sustainable competitive advantage through information technology and artificial intelligence? This strategic capstone course examines how emerging technologies—including AI, platforms, cloud computing, and data systems—reshape industries, disrupt business models, and transform organizational structures.
>
> Students will analyze real companies (Tesla, Amazon, Netflix, Google, OpenAI, Airbnb) to understand how strategic technology adoption creates winning positions. Through case studies, data analysis with Tableau, and team projects, students will develop frameworks for assessing technology readiness, designing transformation roadmaps, and communicating technology strategy to boards and executives.
>
> This course is designed for students seeking careers in technology strategy, innovation leadership, or AI-driven competitive positioning.

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ **Signals AI focus** to students and employers
- ✅ **Emphasizes "strategy"** (board-level thinking, not tactical)
- ✅ **Includes "competitive advantage"** (the business value proposition)
- ✅ **Broad enough** to encompass IT/AI (future-proof)
- ✅ **Clear capstone positioning** (senior/strategic)
- ✅ Differentiates from generic "technology survey" perception

---

### Option 2: **Alternative A** — "AI Strategy & Digital Transformation"

**New Title:**
> **BADM 350: AI Strategy & Digital Transformation**

**New Course Description:**
> Artificial intelligence is reshaping how organizations compete, innovate, and operate at scale. This strategic course explores how AI drives digital transformation—from competitive positioning to operational efficiency to business model innovation.
>
> Students will study how leading companies (Amazon, Google, OpenAI, Tesla) use AI strategically, the organizational changes required for AI adoption, and the governance frameworks needed to manage AI responsibly. Through real-world case studies and strategic projects, students will develop skills to assess AI opportunities, design transformation roadmaps, and lead AI initiatives in their careers.
>
> This course is the capstone for students pursuing AI strategy, digital leadership, or technology-driven innovation.

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ **Clearer AI emphasis** (AI is the subject)
- ✅ **Emphasizes "transformation"** (executive-level concept)
- ✅ **Signals career path** (AI strategy, digital leadership)
- ❌ May narrow perception (what about non-AI technology strategy?)
- ❌ Slightly trendy (could become dated faster than Option 1)

---

### Option 3: **Alternative B** — "Technology & Business Strategy: Building Competitive Advantage Through AI"

**New Title:**
> **BADM 350: Technology & Business Strategy: Building Competitive Advantage Through AI**

**New Course Description:**
> How do leading companies build enduring competitive advantage? This strategic capstone explores how organizations leverage technology and artificial intelligence to reshape industries, disrupt competitors, and create new markets.
>
> Students will examine real cases of technology-driven strategy (Netflix disrupting cable, Airbnb disrupting hospitality, OpenAI disrupting software development) and AI's emerging role as a strategic asset. Through analysis, Tableau visualization, and team projects, students will develop frameworks for technology strategy, organizational readiness, and AI adoption.
>
> This course prepares students for leadership roles requiring technology vision, strategic thinking, and understanding of AI's competitive implications.

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ **Balanced framing** (technology AND AI, strategy is primary)
- ✅ **Long, clear description** (less ambiguous than "IT")
- ✅ **Emphasizes competitive advantage** (the business outcome)
- ✅ **Future-proof** (works if AI becomes commoditized)
- ❌ Title is long (may be cumbersome)
