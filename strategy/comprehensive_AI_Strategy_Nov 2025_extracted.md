Introduction
In 2025, Dean Brooke Elliott assembled a task force to develop a strategy surrounding use of generative 
artificial intelligence (GenAI) Gies College of Business.
The charge from Dean Elliott to this GenAI task force was as follows:
“Define a strategy (and perhaps a framework) so that we are continuously identifying, 
piloting, perhaps building, and definitely implementing AI for IMMEDIATE impact on our 
stakeholders (learners, faculty, staff, and alumni).”
This task force is comprised of staff and faculty members within the College. Since February 2025, the 
task force has met, at a minimum, every other week to discuss and develop this strategy. In developing 
this document, we leveraged industry reports, reached out to other business schools, and some 
company contacts. 
The members of this task force are also involved with projects and committees across Illinois (Gen AI 
Dialogues, OLAC, AI Solutions Hub, Student focus groups, etc.), so we leveraged that knowledge as 
well. While membership has evolved over time, people who have contributed to this strategy include: 
•	 Brook Corwin 
•	 Adam King 
•	 Jamie Nelson 
•	 Steven Pratten 
•	 Vishal Sachdev 
•	 Chris Tidrick
• 	 Martin Mauer
This document outlines the task force’s recommended approach to building a comprehensive GenAI 
strategy for the College. This integrated approach addresses:
1.	 The practical implementation process (how to get things done)
2.	 The skills development pathway (how to build capabilities)
3.	 The specific applications and impacts for stakeholders (what value is created)

Getting Things Done: “Identify, Implement, Impact” Framework
The “Identify, Implement, Impact” framework creates a continuous cycle to deliver immediate value to 
our stakeholders and drive practical implementation of GenAI initiatives at Gies Business.
Identify
opportunities aligned 
with stakeholder needs
Implement
solutions through 
rapid prototyping
Impact
stakeholders by scaling 
successful initiatives
Identify
These actions will allow Gies Business to identify opportunities for AI to create the most immediate 
value to our learning community.
•	 Opportunity Scanning: Establish a quarterly scan and scoring process of emerging GenAI tools 
and topics relevant to workstreams, business learning, teaching, research, and administrative 
operations.
• 	 Stakeholder Needs Assessment: Conduct regular surveys and conversations with students, 
faculty, staff, and alumni to identify pain points that AI could address.
• 	 Competitive Analysis: Monitor how peer institutions are implementing GenAI.
Implement
These actions will allow Gies Business to implement AI solutions into our curriculum and business 
functions and test their effectiveness. 
• 	 Pilot Selection: Choose high-impact, low-implementation-barrier initiatives per semester informed 
by a balanced scorecard and workstream connections.
• 	 Rapid Prototyping: Implement time-bound pilot programs with clear metrics to test longer-term 
viability, effectiveness, and impact with lowered barriers in favor of quicker experimentation.
• 	 Build or Adapt Tools: Set clear criteria for deciding when to build in-house AI capabilities versus 
when to adopt or adapt existing solutions.
• 	 Faculty/Staff Champions: Designate and support early adopters who can demonstrate use cases.

Impact
These actions will allow Gies Business to maximize and demonstrate the value of AI solutions to 
stakeholders.
• 	 Measure and Learn: Prioritize and evaluate AI implementations that deliver clear, immediate, and 
measurable value to stakeholders.
• 	 Scale Winners: Rapidly expand successful pilots college-wide.
• 	 Communicate Progress and Successes: Track outcomes, and share wins and lessons learned 
across all stakeholder groups and the broader community (campus, system, industry).
Building Capabilities: Professional and Learner AI Skills 
Development Framework
To roll out and leverage generative AI effectively, Gies College of Business should expand and support 
AI skill development for learners and professionals throughout the College. Enhancing capabilities will 
happen through two primary initiatives: 
1.	 Professional Development: Workshops, bootcamps, hackathons, personalized learning paths, and 
ongoing development opportunities
2.	 Curriculum Enhancement: AI modules integrated into programs, certificates, courses, along with 
updates to assignments and methods
The AI Skills Development framework illustrates progressive skills development to support fluency, 
implementation, and synergies of Gen AI technology and will help stakeholders at Gies Business 
establish clear and measurable goals for professional development and curriculum enhancement 
throughout the College.

The framework illustrates how individuals move from basic AI literacy to expertise:
• 	 Literacy is achieved when an individual possesses foundational understanding of GenAI concepts, 
capabilities, and limitations (broad base).
• 	 Competency is achieved when an individual possesses practical application skills for using GenAI 
tools effectively in specific contexts.
• 	 Expertise is achieved when an individual possesses advanced capabilities in developing, 
customizing, and optimizing GenAI solutions.
We have adapted this framework for relevancy to Gies Business learners, faculty, and (soon) staff.
