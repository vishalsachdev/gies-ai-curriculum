RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on a benchmarking analysis of AI applications in business schools at 
competitor institutions, Hanover recommends that University of Illinois Gies College 
of Business (Gies):
CONSIDER ASPIRANT PEERS AS MODEL FOR INTEGRATING AI INTO 
BUSINESS TRAINING ACROSS DISCIPLINES AT GIES.
Among the examined peer set, Gies should look to University of 
Michigan’s Ross School of Business and University of California- 
Berkeley’s Haas School as leaders in integrating practical applications 
of AI across their undergraduate and graduate business curricula.   
Michigan’s Ross School has added an AI concentration into its full time 
MBA and launched a series of executive courses, conferences and 
certificates to appeal to a wide range of interested audiences.  These 
include AI implications and use cases in marketing, finance, analytics, 
strategy and ethical decision making. Similarly, the Haas School has 
launched multiple training platforms including courses and certificates 
while ensuring that its core degree students are regularly exposed to 
impacts of AI and machine learning across all business disciplines.  
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP COURSEWORK THAT INCORPORATES REAL 
WORLD AI APPLICATIONS AT ALL LEVELS. 
Gies should offer AI-focused survey courses at the undergraduate and 
graduate level to ensure business students are developing relevant AI-
related competencies that will be necessary to succeed in a variety of 
settings.  Additionally, Gies should strongly encourage the integration 
of AI topics into existing coursework where there are established and 
emerging real-world applications, including business analytics, finance, 
marketing, leadership and ethics.   Many competitors appear to be 
adjusting course content and course offerings to respond to the 
changing landscape, suggesting that Gies should also expect this to be 
a continuous and iterative process.  Examined peers have more robust 
content offerings in the graduate space or executive education, rather 
than at the undergraduate level at present. 
KEY FINDINGS 
Most competitors offer at least one AI-focused course in business at the 
undergraduate level, though options tend to be limited. Four of the six 
competitors offer at least one AI-focused course for undergraduate 
business 
students 
in 
the 
emerging 
field. 
Further, 
AI-focused 
undergraduate coursework tends to take the form of a general survey, 
though one institution offers an advanced elective for AI applications in 
finance.
Two competitors have created a significant portfolio of AI-focused 
course offerings at the master’s level and offer an AI certificate or 
concentration for graduate students. The University of California, 
Berkeley, and the University of Michigan both offer many graduate 
courses that focus on AI applications in business. Both have also 
developed an AI certificate or concentration for their MBA students.
Several competitors have integrated AI into existing programming, 
particularly analytics, operations, and information systems graduate 
business coursework. For example, a few institutions offer several AI-
related courses in their operations and technology clusters. Notably, one 
institution has developed a set of three AI-focused courses for a broad 
audience of business administration students.
Competitors generally integrated non-technical AI competencies in their 
business coursework more often than technical competencies. Master’s-
level courses tended to have more advanced applications of AI, while the 
bachelor’s-level courses were often more introductory in nature. Among 
non-technical competencies, institutions most often integrated AI 
applications (including analytics and algorithms), an introduction to AI, 
and ethical considerations across their undergraduate and graduate 
course offerings. Technical competencies at competitors were less 
common and were only offered at the master’s level in business programs

INTRODUCTION
The Gies College of Business (Gies) at the University of Illinois Urbana-
Champaign is considering how to best incorporate artificial intelligence 
(AI) into its program offerings. As part of this effort, Gies is interested to 
learn more about how peer business schools are integrating AI topics into 
their programming, particularly applications of AI in business disciplines 
and real-world scenarios at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
To better understand the current state of AI in business schools, this 
report reviews specific competitors to determine the presence and focus 
areas of applied AI. The report focuses on trends related to AI training or 
coursework for students. Though AI initiatives may include highly 
technical training, this report focuses on AI initiatives as they relate to 
programming in business schools.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
What should Gies consider as it determines the best path to 
incorporate AI into its programming?
How are business programs preparing their students to enter 
their respective fields by mastering AI competencies?
What business programs 
incorporate AI in business 
applications and scenarios?
What other less technical AI 
competencies, if any, do 
business programs emphasize?
How are peer institutions approaching the infusion of AI into 
their undergraduate and graduate business programming?
What AI courses or trainings, if 
any,  are business students 
required to take?

INSTITUTIONAL TRENDS – OVERVIEW

Institutions across the United States have employed a variety of 
approaches for integrating AI into their business curricula. For example, 
institutions are creating new majors and concentrations as well as 
embedding AI content across existing programming and coursework. 
According to a 2024 survey by the Graduate Management Admission 
Council, 78% of business schools have integrated AI into their curricula 
or learning experiences. Further, around 40% of prospective business 
school students indicated that AI is essential to a business school’s 
curriculum. 
Multiple benchmarked institutions have created webpages explaining 
their approach to integrating AI into their business programming. 
Institutions also may provide a list of competencies that creates goals 
for this integration. For example, the University of Washington’s Foster 
School of Business provides a list of six competencies for students to 
acquire that integrate technology with business (see right). 
In addition to embracing AI applications, benchmarked institutions also 
highlight the importance of ethics training as part of an AI education. 
The University of Michigan clearly states this emphasis on its “AI at 
Michigan Ross” subpage, declaring that its programming should “ ensure 
businesses not only adopt AI effectively but also create and capture value 
ethically.”

BACHELOR’S PROGRAM TRENDS
Most competitors offer at least one AI-focused course in business at the 
undergraduate level, though options tend to be limited.  Four 
benchmarked institutions have developed courses dedicated to AI, 
though options are limited as the curricular area is emerging. In particular, 
the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Michigan, the 
University of Washington, and University of Wisconsin–Madison each 
offer at least one AI-focused course for undergraduate business students 
(see right).
AI-focused undergraduate coursework tends to be a general survey, 
though one institution offers an advanced elective for a finance 
application.  All four of these benchmarked institutions offer a a survey 
course for undergraduate business students in AI. 
Examples include: 
•
University of Wisconsin–Madison lists its AI course as an introduction 
to the foundational concepts and applications of AI in today's business 
world. It covers (1) what AI is, (2) how it works, and (3) its growing 
impact on various business contexts. Topics include predictive AI, 
deep learning, generative AI, leveraging AI tools, and responsible AI.
•
University of Michigan also offers “Artificial Intelligence and Machine 
Learning in Investment Strategies,” indicating that it may be viable for 
institutions to offer advanced AI-focused electives for certain 
undergraduate business majors.
Hanover’s review of curricula at other benchmarked institutions indicate  
that some have integrated AI topics into core business coursework, such 
as with Indiana University and the University of Washington in the 
technical fields of information systems, analytics, and data science. 
Nonetheless, these institutions have yet to develop AI-focused 
coursework for a broader audience of business majors at the 
undergraduate level.

MASTER’S PROGRAM TRENDS
Two competitors have created a significant portfolio of AI-focused 
course offerings at the master’s level and offer an AI certificate or 
concentration for business graduate students. The University of 
California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan both offer at least 10 
graduate courses that focus on AI applications in business. Both 
institutions also have developed an AI certificate or concentration for 
their MBA students. 
•
University of California, Berkeley, launched a new AI for Business 
certificate that will be available to students in its full-time, evening and 
weekend, and executive MBA programs in 2026.
•
 University of Michigan offers an AI concentration for its full-time 
MBA students. These credentials require some sort of distribution of 
core and elective courses in AI (see right).
The University of Florida also advertises that it offers an AI concentration 
in its MS in Management program, though the concentration was not 
listed on the program’s webpage. Given that these types of programs are 
emerging in the marketplace, the University of Florida may be in the 
process of creating such a concentration.
Several competitors have integrated AI into existing programming, 
particularly analytics, operations, and information systems graduate 
business coursework.
•
Indiana University offers many courses with a focus on AI, though 
most of its courses are within the Operations and Decision 
Technologies cluster. 
•
For University of Michigan students outside of its AI Intelligence MBA 
concentration, a similar approach was noted. 
•
University of Washington has developed a set of three AI-focused 
courses for a broad audience of business administration students.

Competitors generally integrated non-technical AI competencies in their 
business coursework more often than technical competencies. Master’s-
level courses tended to have more advanced applications of AI, while the 
bachelor’s-level courses were often more introductory by nature. Among 
non-technical competencies, institutions most often integrated AI 
applications (including analytics and algorithms), an introduction to AI, 
and ethical considerations across their undergraduate and graduate 
course offerings. 
These competencies generally align with larger market trends. According 
to the Graduate Management Admission Council’s 2024 Application 
Trends Survey, the most common way business schools have integrated 
AI into their learning experiences is by (1) exploring the role of AI in 
society and business ethics (44%), (2) developing courses that focus on 
the use of AI in business decision-making processes (43%), and (3) 
incorporating hands-on experience through business simulations and 
practical applications (42%). 
By contrast, technical competencies at competitors were less common 
and were only offered at the master’s level in business programs. 
Benchmarked institutions most often included machine learning and 
quantitative analysis in their coursework, with analytics as another 
prominent focus area.

ranging from data mining and 
data analytics to the use of 
AI in entrepreneurship, 
healthcare, new product 
development, and climate 
research. 
The certificate builds on 
years of experimentation and 
integration by Haas faculty 
who have already begun 
weaving AI topics into core 
MBA courses. However, the 
extend to which these topics 
have been integrated into 
core MBA courses could not 
be determined.

Foster’s AI strategy spans 
four pillars: (1) teaching, (2) 
research, (3) knowledge 
dissemination, and (4) 
operational effectiveness. 
Students build essential 
competencies that integrate 
technology with business. 
They develop fluency in AI, 
ensuring they can responsibly 
apply tools, think critically 
about impact, and drive 
innovation across industries.
Foster’s AI training is 
primarily featured in its M.S. 
in Information Systems 
program, a one-year STEM 
program that blends business 
insight with hands-on 
experience in artificial 
intelligence, data strategy, 
and technology management.

University of 
Wisconsin–
Madison 
Wisconsin 
School of 
Business
WSB has one undergraduate 
AI business offering:
•
Gen Bus 107: 
Introduction to Artificial 
Intelligence in Business 
(covers what AI is, how it 
works, and its growing 
impact on various 
business contexts)
WSB also offers an AI 
Jumpstart: Accelerator 
Course for undergraduates, 
which is an “accelerated 
online course.”
As of October 2025, WSB is 
“designing three new AI 
courses, which are expected 
to be offered in both the 
PMBA and the FTMBA.” 
They are:
•
Gen Bus 707: 
Foundations of Artificial 
Intelligence in Business
•
Gen Bus 708: Artificial 
Intelligence and the 
Enterprise
•
Gen Bus 709: Artificial 
Intelligence and the 
Future of Management
Graduate-level badges and 
certificates do not emphasize 
AI in the current 
configurations.
WSB introduced a one-off 
seminar on AI in the months 
after ChatGPT launched, and 
has been working steadily to 
incorporate AI into its 
curriculum: “In addition to 
hands-on learning 
opportunities like the 
generative AI event, WSB is 
embedding AI learning into 
its course offerings. The 
school already has AI-
relevant courses across 
multiple programs and 
departments and is currently 
developing a new course 
called Competing with AI for 
the redesigned executive 
MBA program.”
The new (2025) AI Hub for 
Business “provides practical 
knowledge, industry 
connections, and academic 
expertise to transform 
business and prepare the 
next generation of business 
leaders.” Hanover found no 
evidence that this initiative 
has influenced the 
curriculum. 
Hanover’s review of the 
MBA core and concentration 
curricular and curricula of 
specialized master’s degrees 
revealed two programs with 
coursework that focuses 
extensively and explicitly on 
AI.
MS in Data, Insights, and 
Analytics and MS in Business 
Analytics courses: 
•
Machine Learning 
•
Artificial Intelligence
•
Current Topics in 
Business Analytics and 
Artificial Intelligence
The MS in Business Analytics 
is a STEM-designated 
program that uses “a 
multidisciplinary approach to 
blend science, technology, 
and data analysis.” It 
therefore offers a more 
technical, as opposed to 
applied, AI curriculum.
Non-Technical:
•
Introduction to AI (2)
•
AI Applications including 
Analytics and Algorithms
•
Future AI Applications
•
