## Course Overview

How do companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Google achieve competitive advantage through AI? This capstone course prepares senior business students to lead organizational AI transformation—from identifying strategic opportunities through implementation challenges to sustaining competitive advantage.

Rather than treating AI as a technology problem, this course frames AI as a **strategic business challenge**: How do we allocate resources? Organize teams? Manage change? Build capabilities? Compete against AI-native startups?

**Core Question:** How do organizations successfully adopt and sustain competitive advantage from AI in their industry?

### Why This Course (vs. Generic Business Policy)?

- **Timely:** AI adoption is accelerating—students will navigate this throughout careers
- **Capstone:** Integrates all business knowledge into strategic decision-making
- **Employer Signal:** "AI Strategy" on transcript signals competitive readiness to top employers

### Learning Outcomes

**Competency Level:**
1. Analyze how AI creates and disrupts competitive advantage in industries
2. Evaluate organizational readiness for AI adoption (talent, data, infrastructure)
3. Formulate AI strategies aligned with organizational capabilities and competitive positioning
4. Assess implementation risks and design mitigation strategies

**Expertise Level:**
1. Create comprehensive AI transformation strategies for organizations
2. Lead cross-functional initiatives to implement AI at scale

## Faculty Notes

### Teaching Philosophy
This is a **strategic thinking** course, not a technical course. The goal is to develop judgment about competitive positioning, organizational capabilities, and business impact—not to teach AI algorithms.

### Key Pedagogical Approaches
1. **Case-driven:** Real companies, real decisions, real trade-offs
2. **Discussion-intensive:** Students debate strategy, not just listen
3. **Bridge to practice:** Frameworks and language used in actual companies
4. **Integration:** Brings together finance, marketing, operations, HR perspectives
5. **Capstone-worthy:** Final project demonstrates readiness for leadership roles

### Classroom Management
- Encourage respectful disagreement (strategy is debatable)
- Call on quieter students (don't let same people dominate)
- Redirect: If discussion becomes too technical, pull back to strategic level
- Balance: Some structure (lecture/framework) but mostly discussion-driven

### Assignment Feedback
- Case analysis: Quick turnaround (within 1 week), focus on strategy rigor
- Capstone: Detailed feedback (written + office hours), treat like board-level feedback
- Reflection: Personal feedback (not graded, but commented on)

### Instructor Preparation
- **Prerequisite:** Deep understanding of AI capabilities/limitations and strategic frameworks
- **Currency:** Keep updated on industry developments (quarterly reading of McKinsey, HBR AI articles)
- **Guest speakers:** Identify 2-3 AI executives for Week 9 + capstone feedback
- **Company updates:** Refresh case studies with latest news (strategy evolves)
- **Capstone calibration:** Decide on real companies vs. student-chosen companies

### Grading Capstone Projects
- Look for **strategic thinking** not just effort
- Does the team understand competitive dynamics?
- Would a real company benefit from this analysis?
- Is the execution plan realistic?
- Are they managing real trade-offs (speed vs. caution, innovation vs. stability)?
