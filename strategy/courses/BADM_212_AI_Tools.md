## Course Overview

This hands-on course teaches business students how to leverage AI tools—from large language models to specialized APIs—to solve real business problems. Rather than learning to build AI from scratch, students master the **practical skills** that 95% of business jobs require: prompt engineering, tool selection, workflow automation, and AI-human collaboration.

**Core Question:** How do I select and use the right AI tools to drive measurable business value while maintaining quality and ethics?

### Why This Course?

- **Market Gap:** Most AI courses teach theory; employers want practitioners
- **Career Ready:** Students graduate with portfolio of AI-powered projects
- **Inclusive:** No coding background required; uses low-code/no-code platforms
- **Practical:** Every assignment is a real business problem

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, students will be able to:

**Competency Level:**
1. Evaluate and select appropriate AI tools based on task requirements and constraints
2. Engineer effective prompts to guide LLM behavior (instruction, context, examples, evaluation)
3. Integrate AI APIs into workflows using low-code platforms (Zapier, Make, etc.)
4. Design human-AI collaboration patterns that enhance decision quality
5. Monitor AI outputs for quality, bias, and alignment with business objectives

## Faculty Notes

### Teaching Philosophy
This course is **project-first, theory-second**. Students learn by doing. Lectures provide just-in-time knowledge to unblock lab work. The goal is to build confidence and competence with real tools that students will use in careers.

### Key Pedagogical Strategies
1. **Lab-driven:** 9 hands-on labs build cumulative skills
2. **Real problems:** Each lab solves actual business scenario
3. **Iterative:** Quality feedback → prompt refinement → better outputs
4. **Practical:** Focus on what works, not deep theory
5. **Portfolio:** Students graduate with projects for job interviews

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-automating simple tasks (focus on high-impact automation)
- Ignoring quality/bias in favor of speed
- Treating AI as magic (emphasize critical evaluation)
- Assuming one tool works for all problems (tool selection matters)

### Instructor Preparation
- **Prerequisite:** Comfort using ChatGPT, Zapier, at least one API
- **Lab setup:** Test all labs with latest models (they evolve!)
- **Tool updates:** APIs change; be ready to adapt
- **Project ideas:** Maintain list of real company problems for student inspiration

### Grading Labs Effectively
- Focus on **process** not just output (did they iterate? improve?)
- Look for signs of learning (prompt refinement, quality thinking)
- Provide constructive feedback on next iteration
