## Three Campus AI Tracks (Focus Areas)

| Track | Description | L-C-E Level |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Track 1: AI Basics** | Foundational concepts, use cases, responsible use | Literacy |
| **Track 3: Agentic Systems** | AI agents for business workflows, automation | Competency → Expertise |
| **Track 4: Human Centric AI** | Ethics, governance, bias, policy, sustainability | Literacy → Competency |

*Note: Track 2 (AI & ML Technologies) is technical/engineering-focused; not primary focus for business core.*

---

## AI Integration Definition

A course is **AI-Integrated** if it includes at least one of:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔧 **AI Tool Use** | Students use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) for coursework |
| 📚 **AI Topic Module** | 1+ class sessions dedicated to AI concepts |
| 📝 **AI-Enhanced Assessment** | Assignments that require or evaluate AI use |
| 💼 **AI Case/Application** | Business cases involving AI decision-making |
| 📋 **AI Policy** | Clear guidelines on responsible AI use |

## Course-to-AI Track Mapping Matrix

### Legend
- **Current Status:** ✅ Has AI | ⚠️ Policy Only | ❌ No AI
- **L-C-E Target:** L = Literacy | C = Competency | E = Expertise
- **Primary Track:** Which AI track this course best supports
- **Integration Priority:** 🔴 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low
