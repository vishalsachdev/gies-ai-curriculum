# Curriculum Evolution: New Courses & Course Redesigns

**Date:** January 4, 2026 | **Scope:** BADM Core Curriculum Enhancement Strategy | **Framework:** Literacy-Competency-Expertise (L-C-E) Progression

---

## Executive Summary

The current BADM core curriculum (7 courses) provides strong foundational AI coverage but has strategic gaps:

- **Only 1 Expertise-level course** (BADM 449) vs. need for 3-4 advanced offerings
- **Human Centric AI underweighted** (2 courses vs. importance of governance/ethics/workforce impact)
- **No dedicated AI governance course** despite regulatory acceleration (EU AI Act, US policy frameworks)
- **No custom AI development pathway** (prompt engineering, API integration, low-code platforms)
- **Limited vertical specialization** (AI in Finance, AI in Operations, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Add 5-7 new courses and rename 4-5 existing courses to create a comprehensive AI leadership program.

## 📋 Decision Points for Leadership

### **Q1 2026 Decisions Required**

1. **Approve Tier 1 Courses (BADM 315, 212, 410)?**
   - Risk of not approving: Fall 2026 enrollment expectations set; delays expertise pathway
   - Resource requirement: Minimal (internal faculty + curriculum design support)

2. **Rename Courses (210, 211) for Marketing Clarity?**
   - Benefit: Immediate signal of AI commitment
   - Risk: Perception of "rebranding" without content change (mitigate by emphasizing redesigns)

3. **Integrate AI into BADM 275, 320, 300, 310?**
   - Benefit: Reaches 3,500+ students immediately with AI content
   - Effort: 40-60 hours faculty time (spread across 4 courses)

4. **Faculty Teaching Assignments for New Courses?**
   - BADM 315: Who teaches AI Governance? (Legal faculty? External hiring?)
   - BADM 212: Who assists with hands-on labs?
   - BADM 410: How much redesign effort for current 449 faculty?

### **Timeline for Decisions**
- **February 2026:** Leadership review + approval
- **March 2026:** Faculty meetings to gauge capacity
- **April 2026:** Course design workshops (with external experts if needed)
- **May 2026:** Curriculum approval through BADM program
