# Curriculum Evolution: New Courses & Course Redesigns

**Date:** January 4, 2026 | **Scope:** BADM Core Curriculum Enhancement Strategy | **Framework:** Literacy-Competency-Expertise (L-C-E) Progression

---

## Executive Summary

The current BADM core curriculum (7 courses) provides strong foundational AI coverage but has strategic gaps:

- **Only 1 Expertise-level course** (BADM 449) vs. need for 3-4 advanced offerings
- **Human Centric AI underweighted** (2 courses vs. importance of governance/ethics/workforce impact)
- **No dedicated AI governance course** despite regulatory acceleration (EU AI Act, US policy frameworks)
- **No custom AI development pathway** (prompt engineering, API integration, low-code platforms)
- **Limited vertical specialization** (AI in Finance, AI in Operations, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Add 4-5 new courses, enhance BADM 350 to "Technology and AI Strategy," and rename 4-5 existing courses to create a comprehensive AI leadership program.
