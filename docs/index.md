# Gies College of Business: AI Curriculum Integration

**Leadership Summary** — January 2026

---

## Executive Brief

> **📋 Three-Minute Summary for Leadership**

**What:** Comprehensive AI integration across undergraduate BADM core curriculum (7 courses)

**Why:**
- Respond to industry demand for AI-literate business graduates
- Align with campus-wide AI Framework (3 tracks: AI Basics, Agentic Systems, Human Centric AI)
- Position Gies as leader in AI-integrated business education

**When:**
- **Spring 2026:** Course design and faculty development
- **Fall 2026:** Launch implementation

**What We're Asking For:**
- Approve **2 new courses**: BADM 315 (AI Governance), BADM 212 (AI Tools)
- Support **1 enhanced course**: BADM 350 "Technology and AI Strategy" (potential BADM 449 capstone replacement)
- Enable **6 course enhancements**: AI modules in BADM 210, 211, 275, 300, 310, 320

**Current Status:** 3 of 8 courses ready; 5 need enhancement by Fall 2026

---

## Key Decisions Required

Leadership approval needed for:

### 1. New Course Creation
- **BADM 315: AI Governance** (300-level, Human Centric track)
  - Focus: Ethics, governance, responsible AI, regulatory frameworks
  - Learning target: Literacy → Competency
  - Addresses critical gap in governance/ethics coverage

- **BADM 212: AI Tools for Business** (200-level, Agentic Systems track)
  - Focus: Hands-on AI tools, automation, practical applications
  - Learning target: Competency
  - Builds on BADM 210/211 analytics foundation

### 2. Course Enhancement
- **BADM 350: Technology and AI Strategy** (enhanced, not new)
  - Existing course with AI strategy content added
  - Could serve as capstone alternative if BADM 449 capacity constraints continue
  - Template ready; synthesis across 5 instructor variants completed
  - Learning target: L→C→E (all three levels)

### 3. Faculty Development Support
- Training for 6 course enhancements (BADM 210, 211, 275, 300, 310, 320)
- Google partnership coordination for faculty development
- Spring 2026 timeline to prepare for Fall 2026 launch

### 4. Resource Allocation
- Course development stipends for new courses
- Technology access (ChatGPT Enterprise, AI tools for student use)
- Assessment framework development

**Timeline for Decision:** Spring 2026 (Q1) to enable Fall 2026 implementation

## Strategic Context

### L-C-E Skills Progression Framework

All AI learning follows a three-level progression adapted from UNESCO AI Competency Framework:

| Level | Definition | What Students Do | Example Action Verbs |
|-------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Literacy (L)** | Foundational understanding of AI concepts, capabilities, and limitations | Understand, explain, identify, recognize AI systems and their applications | Define, Explain, Identify, Recognize |
| **Competency (C)** | Applied skills using AI tools to solve business problems | Apply AI tools, analyze outputs, evaluate results, design solutions | Apply, Use, Design, Evaluate, Analyze |
| **Expertise (E)** | Advanced development and leadership in AI strategy | Create AI strategies, lead initiatives, develop policies, formulate solutions | Create, Develop, Lead, Formulate |

**Progression Example:** A student might start by *defining* what ChatGPT is (Literacy), then *apply* it to analyze business data (Competency), and finally *develop* an AI governance framework for their organization (Expertise).

**Read more:** [Sample AI Learning Outcomes](SAMPLE_AI_LEARNING_OUTCOMES.html) shows specific L-C-E outcomes for each course.

---

### Campus AI Framework (3 Tracks)
1. **Track 1: AI Basics/Fundamentals** — What AI is, capabilities, limitations
2. **Track 3: Agentic Systems & Workflows** — AI agents, automation, business applications
3. **Track 4: Human Centric AI** — Ethics, governance, responsible use, societal impact

*Note: Track 2 (AI & ML Technologies) focuses on technical implementation, model training, and engineering principles—skills primarily covered in computer science and engineering curricula. Business core emphasizes application, strategy, and responsible use rather than technical development.*
