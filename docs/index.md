## Strategic Context

### Campus AI Framework (3 Tracks)
1. **Track 1: AI Basics/Fundamentals** — What AI is, capabilities, limitations
2. **Track 3: Agentic Systems & Workflows** — AI agents, automation, business applications
3. **Track 4: Human Centric AI** — Ethics, governance, responsible use, societal impact

*Note: Track 2 (AI & ML Technologies) focuses on technical implementation, model training, and engineering principles—skills primarily covered in computer science and engineering curricula. Business core emphasizes application, strategy, and responsible use rather than technical development.*

### Skills Progression (UNESCO-adapted)
- **Literacy** — Foundational concepts
- **Competency** — Applied skills in business contexts
- **Expertise** — Advanced development and leadership
