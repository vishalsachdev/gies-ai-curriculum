---

## Executive Summary

Gies College of Business is implementing a comprehensive AI integration strategy to ensure every graduate develops practical AI literacy and discipline-specific competencies. The strategy combines immediate operational improvements, curriculum enhancements, and long-term transformation goals aligned with campus-wide initiatives and market demands.

**Key Timeline:** Implementation targets Fall 2026 for undergraduate AI learning initiatives as a top college priority.

---

## Preamble: Official Campus AI Framework Context

**IMPORTANT:** This Gies strategy is designed to **contribute to and align with the official Campus AI Framework** that was finalized by the Provost's Campus AI Curriculum Task Force in December 2025.

### Official Campus AI Learning Framework (Four Tracks)

The Campus AI Task Force established an **official AI Literacy Framework with four learning tracks** (source: *Gies AI Strategy End of Term Update.docx*, December 2025):

1. **AI Basics/Fundamentals**
   - Foundational competencies, AI use cases, critical thinking, responsible use
   - Focus: Understanding what AI is and its applications
   - **Gies Opportunity:** Provide foundational electives in business domain areas (e.g., "AI for Marketing," "AI for Finance," "AI for Supply Chain")

2. **AI and ML Technologies**
   - Intermediate/advanced competencies for learners designing, building, evaluating AI tools
   - Requires strong Python coding, ML, and LLM knowledge
   - Focus: Technical depth for future AI specialists
   - **Gies Role:** Business-specific ML applications courses

3. **Agentic Systems & Workflows**
   - Intermediate/advanced: understand and customize agentic AI for workflow improvement
   - Focus: Practical implementation of AI agents in real business processes
   - **Gies Opportunity:** **Lead nationally on "Agentic AI for Business Workflows"** (especially HR, supply chain, operations)
   - Note: Grainger piloting course for engineers; campus seeking similar course for non-engineers with prerequisites CS 105, BADM 210, BADM 211

4. **Human Centric AI**
   - Basic/intermediate for liberal arts and social sciences students
   - Focus: AI limits, AI+society, sustainability, design and governance of AI systems
   - **Gies Role:** Business ethics, governance, policy perspectives on AI

### How Gies Contributes vs. Creates

**Official Guidance** (source: *Gies AI Strategy End of Term Update.docx*):
> "Colleges such as Gies can provide foundational electives in their domain areas as a part of an AI Fundamentals certificate"

**And:**
> "The task force will review and integrate AI in our analytics offerings and determine coursework to contribute to the campus AI minor and X + AI initiatives."

**Gies Strategic Options:**
1. **Option A (Recommended):** Contribute business-specific courses to campus framework while developing Gies-specific applications
   - Gies courses become electives in campus AI Fundamentals track
   - Gies develops leadership track on Agentic AI for business
   - Aligns with campus structures; positions Gies as business domain expert

2. **Option B:** Develop parallel Gies AI program alongside campus framework
   - More autonomy; Gies controls full curriculum
   - Risk: Duplication, reduced collaboration, less visibility in campus system
   - Resource-intensive

3. **Option C:** Hybrid approach
   - Contribute select courses to campus tracks
   - Develop specialized Gies programs (e.g., Business + AI X+AI degree with Gies leading)
   - Maintains flexibility while staying connected to campus initiative

**This Strategy Assumes Option A (Contribution Model)** — which leverages campus infrastructure while positioning Gies as business-domain leader.
