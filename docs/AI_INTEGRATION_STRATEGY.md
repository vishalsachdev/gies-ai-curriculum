## Tier 1: Fall 2026 Implementation

### Two New Courses

| Course | Level | Focus | Learning Target |
|--------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **BADM 315** | 300 | Governance, ethics, responsible AI | Literacy → Competency |
| **BADM 212** | 200 | Hands-on AI tools, automation | Competency |

### One Enhanced Course (Potential BADM 449 Replacement)

| Course | Level | Focus | Learning Target |
|--------|-------|-------|-----------------|
